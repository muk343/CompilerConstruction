Compiler-Construction
=====================

Compiler construction project done for course CS F363 @BITS-Pilani. My team partner was Abhinav Bhatia.

Duration: II Semester 2013-14 (Jan 2014 - May 2014).
Compiler Target platform: MASM for Intel 8086
Language used: C

A language description was given for which we had to develop a compiler.

We were the project toppers in our batch :) !!
Our compiler was later used in an Master's level course on compiler optimization.
